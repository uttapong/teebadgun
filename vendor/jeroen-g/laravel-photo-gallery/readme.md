Laravel Photo Gallery
=====================

A photo gallery for Laravel 4.

## Installation
First you should install this package through Composer and edit your project's `composer.json`:

    "require": {
		"laravel/framework": "4.0.*",
		"jeroen-g/laravel-photo-gallery": "v1.0"
	}

Next, update Composer via the command line:

    composer update

The next step is to add the service provider in `app/config/app.php`:

    'JeroenG\LaravelPhotoGallery\LaravelPhotoGalleryServiceProvider',

The last thing to do is to migrate:

	php artisan migrate --package="jeroen-g/laravel-photo-gallery"

This will create the tables for the gallery. Now you're ready to start!

## Usage
The photos will be uploaded to the folder `public/uploads/photos/`.

If you want to change the way the gallery looks you can create a file with the same name in `app/views/gallery`. For example, if you want to change the master layout, you should creat the file `app/views/gallery/layouts/master.blade.php`.
