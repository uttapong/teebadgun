Dear Friend

I would like to solicit for your cooperation in a deal that involves the transfer of US $12.6 million to your account for investment projects in your country.
 
Introduction: My name is Brian Timothy, a lawyer by profession. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Mikie Gould, a national of Russia, who worked with Nautical Petroleum Plc in UK, hereinafter shall be referred to as my client.
 
On the 21st of April 2010, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved in a car accident along the M4 Western Motorway. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several efforts to find any of his relatives but has been unsuccessful.
 
Business Proposal: Before his death, he deposited US $12.6 million in a Financial Firm (name withheld). After these several unsuccessful efforts, I decided to contact you because the Financial Firm has issued me a notice to present his Next of Kin within the next 30 official working days or have the funds declared unserviceable and returned to the treasury as unclaimed in accordance with existing law/policy here in the UK. Since I have been unsuccessful in finding his relatives for over 4 years now, I am actually asking for your consent to present you to the Financial Firm as the Next of Kin and business partner to late Mikie Gould, so that the funds will be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.
 
I shall provide all the legal documents if required to back up your claim as Next of Kin to late Mikie. All I require from you is your honest co-operation to enable us achieve this transaction. This proposition is entirely risk free and I will use my position as attorney to late Mikie to help you procure all the required legal papers which will give you full legal protection anywhere in the world.
 
Note: You may not be anyway related to my late client but I assure you that all would be put in place in accordance with the Law to legally present you as the Next of Kin to late Mikie and true beneficiary of the funds so that the money will be paid to us. I am considering this arrangement because I don't want the funds to be returned as unclaimed. I have decided to give 10% of the funds to charity, while the remaining will be shared equally between us. 

If you are interested in this proposal, could you get back to me via e-mail:braintimothy7@gmail.com or telephone 00447045760520 to enable us discuss in a more vivid manner to the best of your understanding. Should you have any question, you can call me for further discussion?
 
Conclusion: The intended transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement. However, if this business proposition offends your moral ethics, do accept my sincere apology.
 
Thanks. I await your positive response soon.

Regards 
Brian Timothy
