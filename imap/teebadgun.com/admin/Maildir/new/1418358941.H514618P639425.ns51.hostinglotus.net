My beloved in the Lord,

I am Mrs Juliet Alexander John. I write to you from my sick bed in the hospital. I have been diagnosed of lung cancer and after several tests, the doctors told me I have 50-50
chances of survival. However, without wasting much of your time, I want you to know that my late husband, Mr. John Alexander had in his fixed deposit the sum of $12.5 million
before he died. He was a member of the Contract Procurement Unit of the Economic Community of West African States. Please, due to the deteriorating state of my health, I want to make sure this money is transferred to your designated bank account as soon as possible. If my health allows me, I would like to come to your country after the transfer of money to see if I can get real medical care as there are no good medical facilities here in Ghana

Please reply me as soon as possible and try to save my soul so I can give you detailed information and document relating to the money in the bank so that you can ask the bank to make the transfer of the funds to your bank account. If you agree to help me, I will inform the bank also intimating them of your application to transfer funds to your bank
account.

Please, I am waiting for your urgent response.

Remain blessed as you come to my aid.

Mrs. Juliet John Alexander .
